DATA SCIENCE TASKS:

TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
SOURCE: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset/
TASK: Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.

MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
SOURCE: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies TASK: Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression techniques to tackle this problem.
The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
SOURCE: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset TASK: The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. 
Now, imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.

SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

SOURCE 2: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input
TASK: Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.

CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
SOURCE: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
TASK:Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.
